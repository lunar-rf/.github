Hi there, I am a young **electrical engineer (EE)** with a passion for software and electronics engineering.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 I graduated from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) where I obtained my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering. I am a passionate and curious engineer with an interest in learning new technologies. My personal blog can be found at [spacehen.io](http://spacehen.io).

On my GitHub you can find a range of software projects I have worked on which mainly relate to embedded systems/firmware development as well as IC (integrated circuit) emulation. I am a contributor to the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=10901).
