Hi there, I am a young electrical engineer (EE) with a passion for software and electronics engineering.<br/>
<br/>
On my GitHub profile you can find a range of software projects I have worked on which mainly relate to embedded systems/firmware development as well as IC (integrated circuit) emulation.
