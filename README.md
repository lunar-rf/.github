Hi there, I am a young electrical engineer (EE) with a passion for software and electronics engineering.<br/>
<br/>

On my GitHub you can find a range of software projects I have worked on which mainly relate to embedded systems/firmware development as well as IC (integrated circuit) emulation. I am a contributor to the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=10901).
