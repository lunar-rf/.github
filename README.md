### Hi there!

My name is **Dylan Muller** and I am an **electrical engineer (EE) and Linux developer** from **Cape Town, South Africa**.<br/>
<br/>
From 2017-2021 I attended the **University of Cape Town** where I obtained my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering. I am a passionate and curious engineer with an interest in learning new technologies. My personal blog can be found [here](https://spacehen.github.io/).
 <br/>

Here you can find a range of software projects I have worked on which mainly relate to embedded systems/firmware development as well as IC (integrated circuit) emulator design. I am also a contributor to the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=10901).
