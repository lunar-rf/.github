### Hi there!

My name is **Dylan Muller** and I am an **electrical engineer (EE)** from **Cape Town, South Africa**.<br/>
<br/>
I graduated in 2021 from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) where I obtained my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering. I am a passionate and curious engineer with an interest in learning new technologies. My personal blog can be found [here](https://spacehen.github.io/). I also have a Youtube channel which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaMFkzhPAa8-6MzlFo5jz6Q).
 <br/>

On my GitHub you can find a range of software projects I have worked on which mainly relate to embedded systems/firmware development as well as IC (integrated circuit) emulation. I am a contributor to the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=10901).
